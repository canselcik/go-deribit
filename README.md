`adampointer/go-deribit` is no longer maintained and seems to suffer from some race conditions that lead to some issues around multiple sessions.

This repo contains the extracted `v3` module (which was the latest supported variant of the repo) and a few patches applied on it.

The issue around multiple sessions isn't fully addressed yet. Feel free to submit a PR or create an issue to discuss the future of the repository.
